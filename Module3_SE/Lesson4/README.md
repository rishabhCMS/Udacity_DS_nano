# Lesson 4: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Why OOP?

    1. OOP allows us to create large modular programs that can expand over time

    2. OOP hides the implementation from the end-user.

    objects are defined by characteristics and actions.
    
    for example: a colthing store is an object, the sales-person is an object, the cloth is an object
    
    here, if sales person is an object, they have the charateristics of name, age, hourly pay, hours worked, and her actions are to sell
    
## Class, Object, Method & Attribute

**Charateristics**: Attributes

**Actions**: Methods

    Difference between a method and a function is that, a function is defined outside the class and a method is defined inside the class
    
    ````python Self ```` tells Python where to look in the computer's memory for the object
