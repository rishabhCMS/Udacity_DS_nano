# Experimental Design And Recommendation systems


## Content
Experimental Design & Recommendation Engines
The upcoming course is comprised of two broad topics: experimental design and recommendation engines.

Experimental Design
Within the experimental design portion of this course, there are three lessons:

I. Concepts of Experiment Design
Here you will learn about what it means to run an experiment, and how this differs from observational studies. Topics include not only what to include in an experimental design, but also what to watch out for when designing an experiment.

II. Statistical Considerations in Testing
In this lesson, you will learn about statistical techniques and considerations used when evaluating the data collected during an experiment. It is expected that you come into the course with knowledge about inferential statistics; the content here will see you applying that knowledge in different ways.

III. A/B Testing Case Study
Here, you will put your skills to work to analyze data related to a change on a web page designed to increase purchasers of software.

At the end of these lessons, you can complete an optional Portfolio Exercise in coordination with our industry partner Starbucks. In the project, you will learn more about how Starbucks conducts experiments. You will also get access to data related to a hiring screen that was once conducted by Starbucks to test ideas related to experimental design and statistical metrics.

Recommendation Engines
The recommendation engines portion of the course has two lessons:

I. Introduction to Recommendation Engines
In this lesson, you will learn about the main ideas associated with recommendation engines. This includes techniques and measures of effectiveness.

II. Matrix Factorization for Recommendations
Extending on the previous lesson, you will learn about one of the most popular techniques for recommendation engines known as FunkSVD. You will also complete a class that brings together a number of techniques to make recommendations for a number of different scenarios.


What's Ahead
Types of Recommendations
In this lesson, you will be working with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:

Knowledge Based Recommendations
Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations
Content Based Recommendations
Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:

Model Based Collaborative Filtering
Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering
In this lesson, you will implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering. In the next lesson, you will implement Model Based Collaborative Filtering.

Similarity Metrics
In order to implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, you will learn about some common ways to measure the similarity between two users (or two items) including:

Pearson's correlation coefficient
Spearman's correlation coefficient
Kendall's Tau
Euclidean Distance
Manhattan Distance
You will learn why sometimes one metric works better than another by looking at a specific situation where one metric provides more information than another.

Business Cases For Recommendations
Finally, you will look at the four ideas needed for businesses to implement successful recommendations to drive revenue, which include:

Relevance
Novelty
Serendipity
Increased Diversity
At the end of this lesson, you will have gained a ton of skills to build upon or to start creating your own recommendations in practice.
