## 1. Extract data from different sources such as:



## 2. Transform data


## 3. Load

## ETL Pipeline

** to find the encoding of a file**
```` python
# import the chardet library
import chardet 

# use the detect method to find the encoding
# 'rb' means read in the file as binary
with open("mystery.csv", 'rb') as file:
    print(chardet.detect(file.read()))
````

## Missing data

Gradient Boosting Decision trees can handle missing values
